Qingpeng contributed code to do unique k-mer counting.

Adina Howe, Rosangela Canino-Koning, and Arend Hintze contributed
significantly to discussions of approaches and algorithms; Adina wrote
a number of scripts.

paired-end support for digital normalization.

Eric McDonald thoroughly revised many aspects of the code base, made
much of the codebase thread safe, and otherwise improved performance
